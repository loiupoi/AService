AService — Lightweight Module Script Manager for Roblox Studio

Description:
AService simplifies working with modular scripts in Roblox Studio, replacing messy collections of scattered ModuleScripts with a centralized system. All services are stored in one place and accessed through a single module. Create, run, stop, send events, and destroy services without managing multiple references or repeating code.

Features:

📦 Centralized service storage: easily find and manage all scripts in one folder.

⚡ Simple API: CreateService, WriteService, RunService, TerminateService, SentService, DestroyService, ReturnMainService.

🔄 Unified state: AService instance manages all services, avoiding inconsistencies.

🔔 Event support: use BindableEvents within services instead of global events.

🛠️ Compact and extendable: only one module per project, easy to add new services. 

👌Less than 200 lines of code.
